1) install python3.10.10 with "add to PATH" option enabled and at the end "DISABLE PATH LENGTH"
2) put winsdr config files in ./conf
3) run main.py and expect output files at ./output
4) enjoy :)

NOTE: on first run of "main.py" it will try to download the missing packages and exit so you must run the file again
